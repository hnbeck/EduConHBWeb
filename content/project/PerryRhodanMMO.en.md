There are a lot MMO on the market. My interest is interactive story telling. Because I'm a fan of the German publication "Perry Rhodan" of Pabel-Moewig Verlag, Rastatt (siehe [Perry Rhodan Website](https://perry-rhodan.net/)), I like to create a fan project around this universe: an MMO with interactive story telling. The prototype will be done in Prolog, becaus Prolog supports rule, knowledge managenemt very well. This are all points important for an adventure game. 
The prototype is intended to try what an interactive story telling could be and how to match this wonderful univers of Perry Rhodan stories and characters.

For details look at [German version of this post](/project/perryrhodanmmo/). Translation may be a subject for future.
