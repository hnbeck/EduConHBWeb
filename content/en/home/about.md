### Mission and Vision

Philosophy, story telling and gaming are the foundation of my work. Story telling is my way to develop philosophical insight and to seek for its applications. Games are a model of the world. To design gaming rules is like experimenting with universum and evultion in a constructive way. Games are also some kind of story telling. My focus is at structure and rules as basic machanism of the universe and artificial autonomous systems.
