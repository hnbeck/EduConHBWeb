Persistence is important. Storing and managing data is the big thing shaping our world and induce so many things in computer science. If a computer takes the task to handle data it means that it has to handle a lot of data. And of course the computer is required to provide means to get the data back. But the human is clever. In history, in the early days of computing, to get the data back was enough. Today the computer shall provide us new insights. Who wants read boring data if one could get information or even knowledge? Charts, statisical hypothesis about what will happen next and even knowlege are the matter of interest.
 
We see: storing and accessing data is important, but also processing them like

+  counting
+  associate them
+  categorize them
+  filter them

is behind of that simple term "persistence". A lot of theory and structures were invented to manage these tasks. Relational databases, object databases, graph databases and more can be found today in the market as well as in the open souce world. Many books are available explaining this topic in detail, for example (thanks to Anne Ogborn for the hint!)
