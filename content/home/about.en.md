## Mission and Vision

To play is part of human nature. Games help us to learn, to explore and to evolve. If designes well games can do more than entertain you. They can transport knowledge. Games can reflect attribures of a character, which makes them suitable for experiments in computer based constructive psychology. Thats what my work is all about. Own small projects help, to experience my ideas.
